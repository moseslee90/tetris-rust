# tetris-rust
A rust project to generate a tetris artificial intelligence through the genetic algorithm

Project currently still in development.

Current Status:

Tetris structure and pieces expressed in arrays built.
Movement and rotation functions implemented.
Line clearing not added.
Explicit user controls not yet implemented.
Game currently only displays 'visuals' via command line

Priority is to create environment for Machine Learning algorithm to run in.
Tentative algorithm chosen to be implemented is currently Genetic Algorithm (not yet implemented).

Example output of current game structure can be seen by running:

cargo run

Movement and rotation can be observed by manipulating change_piece and rotate_piece functions.
